# Rune-Fractal Launchpad

The Rune Token Launchpad, which operates on the Rune protocol within the Fractal Bitcoin Network, serves as a platform for listing newly created Rune tokens and showcasing their minting progress. It enables users to deploy, mint, and transfer Rune tokens on their own.  
This project is built using JavaScript/TypeScript and Node.js, offering a robust and scalable solution for managing Rune tokens efficiently across the network.
